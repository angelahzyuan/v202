title: Self-Repellent Random Walks on General Graphs - Achieving Minimal Sampling Variance
  via Nonlinear Markov Chains
openreview: 450iImFM4U
abstract: We consider random walks on discrete state spaces, such as general undirected
  graphs, where the random walkers are designed to approximate a target quantity over
  the network topology via sampling and neighborhood exploration in the form of Markov
  chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures. Given any Markov chain corresponding to a target
  probability distribution, we design a <em>self-repellent random walk</em> (SRRW)
  which is less likely to transition to nodes that were highly visited in the past,
  and more likely to transition to seldom visited nodes. For a class of SRRWs parameterized
  by a positive real $\alpha$, we prove that the empirical distribution of the process
  converges almost surely to the the target (stationary) distribution of the underlying
  Markov chain kernel. We then provide a central limit theorem and derive the exact
  form of the arising asymptotic co-variance matrix, which allows us to show that
  the SRRW with a stronger repellence (larger $\alpha$) always achieves a smaller
  asymptotic covariance, in the sense of Loewner ordering of co-variance matrices.
  Especially for SRRW-driven MCMC algorithms, we show that the decrease in the asymptotic
  sampling variance is of the order $O(1/\alpha)$, eventually going down to zero.
  Finally, we provide numerical simulations complimentary to our theoretical results,
  also empirically testing a version of SRRW with $\alpha$ increasing in time to combine
  the benefits of smaller asymptotic variance due to large $\alpha$, with empirically
  observed faster mixing properties of SRRW with smaller $\alpha$.
