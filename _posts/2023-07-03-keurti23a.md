title: Homomorphism AutoEncoder -- Learning Group Structured Representations from Observed
  Transitions
openreview: Ph7EfTA2DI
abstract: How can agents learn internal models that veridically represent interactions
  with the real world is a largely open question. As machine learning is moving towards
  representations containing not just observational but also interventional knowledge,
  we study this problem using tools from representation learning and group theory.
  We propose methods enabling an agent acting upon the world to learn internal representations
  of sensory information that are consistent with actions that modify it. We use an
  autoencoder equipped with a group representation acting on its latent space, trained
  using an equivariance-derived loss in order to enforce a suitable homomorphism property
  on the group representation. In contrast to existing work, our approach does not
  require prior knowledge of the group and does not restrict the set of actions the
  agent can perform. We motivate our method theoretically, and show empirically that
  it can learn a group representation of the actions, thereby capturing the structure
  of the set of transformations applied to the environment. We further show that this
  allows agents to predict the effect of sequences of future actions with improved
  accuracy.
