title: Never mind the metrics---what about the uncertainty? Visualising binary confusion
  matrix metric distributions to put performance in perspective
openreview: IuQAcE137v
abstract: There are strong incentives to build classification systems that show outstanding
  performance on various datasets and benchmarks. This can encourage a narrow focus
  on models and the performance metrics used to evaluate and compare themâ€”resulting
  in a growing body of literature to evaluate and compare <em>metrics</em>. This paper
  strives for a more balanced perspective on binary classifier performance metrics
  by showing how uncertainty in these metrics can easily eclipse differences in empirical
  performance. We emphasise the discrete nature of confusion matrices and show how
  they can be well represented in a 3D lattice whose cross-sections form the space
  of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We develop novel interactive
  visualisations of performance metric contours within (and beyond) ROC space, showing
  the discrete probability mass functions of true and false positive rates and how
  these relate to performance metric distributions. We aim to raise awareness of the
  substantial uncertainty in performance metric estimates that can arise when classifiers
  are evaluated on empirical datasets and benchmarks, and that performance claims
  should be tempered by this understanding.
